## -- PROBLEM 5 -- ##
#####################

# Read this problem statement carefully!

# Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a
# teen -- in the range 13-19 inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, except 15
# and 16 do not count as a teens. Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that
# takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule.
#
# In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition").
# Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum().
# Again, you will have two functions for this problem!
#
# Examples:
#
# no_teen_sum(1, 2, 3) â†’ 6
# no_teen_sum(2, 13, 1) â†’ 3
# no_teen_sum(2, 1, 14) â†’ 3


  # CODE GOES HERE
a=2
b=16
c=14

def fix_teen(n):
    if n >= 13 and n <= 18 and n != 15 and n != 16:
        return 0
    else:
        return n

def no_teen_sum(a, b, c):
    print(fix_teen(a) + fix_teen(b) + fix_teen(c))

print(no_teen_sum(a,b,c))
